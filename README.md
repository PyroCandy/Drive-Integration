# Google Drive Integration

The application requires Google Authentication for Drive access. Then proceeds to store the credentials acquired locally which is then used to access the Google Drive. 

The file names, date of modification and the ID of the files and folders are fetched and stored in the output/result.txt in JSON format.

Once the Jetty Server is running, the user can click on the button to fetch changes from the Drive and make necessary changes to the JSON file.
